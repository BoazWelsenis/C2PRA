    <h1>U Prising - My Baby</h1>
    <p>Allow me in your tub
Just allow me in your club
Allow me to drink from your cup
I'll be coming back for more
Allow me in your dream
Allow me in your scene
Just allow me on your knees
I'll be coming back for more
Sisters, keep on rising
Brothers, keep on rising
This girl keeps on rising
Keep on rising up
All I Believe in your school
I Believe in your rules
I Believe in your truth
I'll be coming back for more
I Believe in your land
I Believe in that man
I Believe in your command
I'll be coming back for more
Sisters, Brothers, Lovers
Keep on rising up
Sisters, keep on rising
Brothers, keep on rising
This girl keeps on rising
Keep on rising up
Uprising, uprising
Uprising, uprising
Sisters, Brothers, Lovers
This girl keep on rising up
Sisters, keep on rising
Brothers, keep on rising
This girl keeps on rising
Keep on rising up</p>
    <h1>U Prising - Muse</h1>
    <p>Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)
Another promise, another scene
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)
Interchanging mind control
Come, let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)</p>
    <h1>Plug in baby - Muse</h1>
    <p>I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love
My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living
Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love
My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
And tired of living
And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone</p>
